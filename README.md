# PinballGame---JeremiahJP
For this project my intentions for this project was completely random. I honestly had no clue what theme to do, but since im into Pokemon I just thought of going with a Pokemon Themed Game.
I honestly learned a lot from this project such as the unity physics, Game Menu's (Buttons, etc), Particles, and probably more. I honestly enjoyed exploring in this project as I got to try a bunch of new things
and see what worked and what didnt work for me. I think I did decent, I wouldve liked to learn animations for my buttons on my start menu and probably wanted to spend more time learning other things, but didn't have the time to.
I would hopefully like to revisit this project in the future and polish it up a bit as I did enjoy and had fun making this project.
